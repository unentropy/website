I've been writing software for over two decades. In the last year, the way I work has changed more than in all the years before. AI-assisted coding is a revolution—I'm convinced of that. I'm also convinced we're not talking enough about the hard parts.

## Who I Am

I'm Mateusz, CTO at [Cleeng](https://cleeng.com)—a subscription management platform for D2C brands. We run the kind of codebase where technical decisions made years ago still matter today.

I care about the long game: maintainability, sustainability, the things that compound.

## Why This Blog Exists

I use AI tools daily. They're remarkable.

But I also see risks that get lost in the noise. Security vulnerabilities slip in faster when code is generated faster. Technical debt accumulates when developers don't fully understand what they've shipped. Code entropy - the gradual decay of a codebase's coherence - is accelerating.

These concerns tend to get drowned out by the hype cycle. I think the industry needs more skeptical, practical voices. Not fear-mongering, just honest takes from people doing the work.

## What to Expect Here

I'll be writing about:

- **Tech management**—maintaining long-living projects, refactoring strategies, team dynamics
- **Technical deep-dives**—the actual engineering work
- **AI-era frameworks**—practices for keeping quality high when generation is cheap

No hype. No doom. Just a practitioner's perspective on building software that lasts.
